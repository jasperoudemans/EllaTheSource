          In this photograph, Ella is seen bestowing Divine Love on a child
          while in a car (child's face has been cropped out for privacy). The
          radiating power of Ella's Love (which is her essence) is an
          unmistakable feeling full of warmth. May we all learn to love as
          perfectly and purely as Ella does.

          In this photograph, Ella is seen bestowing the gift of perfect Love
          through her Divine gaze. Ella can bestow Love so powerfully through
          her gaze alone, that grown truckers break down in tears and fall to
          their knees and worship Her paws.

          In this photograph, Ella is seen blessing a hamper full of clothes.
          Ella sat in a state of perfect contentment for hours to lovingly bless
          these clothes. Her being is established in Love, therefore her
          presence is the presence of Love itself. Expressing Herself as Love,
          Ella is the Source of Love.

          In this photograph, Ella is seen practicing canine meditation. Ella is
          beyond the concept of authority, so she chooses not to give
          instructions on any particular meditative technique. Ella sees that
          all is Unity, all is Love, so she refuses to place Herself above
          others in the position of a teacher. We can only speculate as to the
          methods being employed in this moment of meditative perfection in the
          life of the Divine Source incarnate.
