          In this photograph, Ella is seen bestowing Divine Love on a child
          while in a car (child's face has been cropped out for privacy). The
          radiating power of Ella's Love (which is her essence) is an
          unmistakable feeling full of warmth. May we all learn to love as
          perfectly and purely as Ella does.

          In this photograph, Ella is seen bestowing the gift of perfect Love
          through her Divine gaze. Ella can bestow Love so powerfully through
          her gaze alone, that grown truckers break down in tears and fall to
          their knees and worship Her paws.
